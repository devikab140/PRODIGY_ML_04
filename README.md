# Hand Gesture Recognition Using Convolutional Neural Networks

## Introduction
Hand gesture recognition is essential for applications in human-computer interaction, sign language interpretation, and gaming. This project aims to develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to recognize hand gestures from images.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the LeapGestRecog dataset, which contains images of various hand gestures. The dataset is organized into directories corresponding to different gestures, each containing multiple images of that gesture. This dataset provides a good variety of gestures and poses, making it suitable for training a robust hand gesture recognition model.The dataset is from https://www.kaggle.com/gti-upm/leapgestrecog

## Objectives
- Develop a CNN model for accurate hand gesture recognition.
- Achieve high accuracy and generalization across different gestures.
- Provide a foundation for real-time gesture-based applications.

## Methodology
### Data Loading and Preprocessing
- Loading Data: Load images and labels from the dataset.
- Preprocessing: Resize images, normalize pixel values, and encode labels.
### Model Development
- Model Architecture: Create a CNN with multiple convolutional and pooling layers, followed by dense layers for classification.
- Compilation: Compile the model with an appropriate loss function and optimizer.
### Model Training
- Training: Train the model using the training dataset and validate it with a validation dataset.
- Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance on a test dataset.
### Visualization and Analysis
- Visualization: Plot training history, including accuracy and loss curves.
- Predictions: Use the trained model to make predictions on new images.

## Conclusion
Hand gesture recognition using CNNs significantly improves human-computer interaction. This project aims to develop a robust model for recognizing hand gestures, providing a basis for various applications.
